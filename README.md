### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning: PHP and Ruby  

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on: my very own social network CMS

ðŸ“« How to reach me & join me: https://net-twin.de/net/NetTwin or at https://prattle.space/Andreas

ðŸ’¬ Ask me about: anything that makes sense

âš¡ Fun fact: imagine there is free beer and nobody knows where

ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in: Web design, web development, classic art such as painting, I create knives and have a good 13 years of experience, I like horror and sci-fi films, I like music that bangs like techno, dubstep or hevy metal, but also modern classics and film music such as by TwoStepsFromHell and I like dogs - there is a lot more, but that would go beyond the scope
